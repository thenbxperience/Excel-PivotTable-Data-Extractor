# Excel-PivotTable-Data-Extractor
This PowerShell script will automatically extract specified data from an Excel PivotTable and write it to a text document.  Your will need to open this in a text editor and fill in your own values, including file paths and filter names and specifications.  You can also add a header and footer to the output.  

This is handy for LISTSERVs if you need to extract mailing list data from a PivotTable and want to save a ton of time and effort.

Note: It copies the first line twice for some unknown reason.
